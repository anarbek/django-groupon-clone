It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pretty simple; we do our best to give people unbeatable deals everyday so they can comfortably try new and exciting things they may have not had a chance to try otherwise.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWithout our community we're really nothing. We really encourage our users to get involved in our daily discussions, ask questions, share the deals through Twitter, Facebook and Email, and really help spread the word of collective buying!",
